# PokemonAsAPI

This is an example repo to show how a consumer and service can interact with each other. 

In order to load the data on the consumer and also add new data make sure that both the project PokemonAPI and PokemonConsumer is running.

PokemonAPI swagger UI can be found on: 
https://localhost:7065/index.html

And PokemonConsumer can be found on:
https://localhost:7168/

I will advice you to run with multiple startup projects to test how the two applications interact.
Instead of a list of pokemon models on the API a database could have been implemented to store all the pokemons that are generated. This is not implemented for now
